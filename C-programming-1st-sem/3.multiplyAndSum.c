//! No need to copy this comment section This is just for some newbies
//? how does this code work?
/* this code is not complex for those who have learnt C, but for some the printing section might be a bit complex
All this code does is it prints the values of a*b if a is 10 and b is 8 it prints 80,
no need for third variable declaration*/
